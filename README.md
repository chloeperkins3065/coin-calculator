This porgram takes the number of each coin that you have and calculates that total for the user. It is really a simple code,
it tells the user what program they are opening and welcomes them. So it starts with a welcome message. The program then promps 
the user to type in the number of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, half dollars, a dollar coins. After the user has input the
number of each coin that they have. The program will restate the what the user typed in. After the program has told the user 
the numbers that the program will use for the math. The program will then take the imput and do some math to produce the total 
amount of money that the user has within the change. The program just allows the user to not have to do the math on how much they
have in change, now there is a program out there that does it for them.
